# Domineering_game_simulation

This project focus on simulating Domineering game that is a mathematical game played on a sheet of graph paper, using Monte Carlo simulation and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for a game. It was performed with three main goals: 

  1. Generate data with a Monte Carlo evaluation for a game so as to learn a policy network.
  2. Simulation of the moves by applying an evaluation of Monte Carlo and CNN in order to carry out the fight between two network architectures.
  3. Calculate the error and the percentage with different network architectures.
  
  
# Prerequisites

- Python 3.5
- NumPy 1.11.3
- keras 2.2.2

For training the CNN model, you need to download the dataset from this link: [domineering dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1136uY7B1N5udfsSpo8vowdlo1rpMhqG9/view?usp=sharing)
